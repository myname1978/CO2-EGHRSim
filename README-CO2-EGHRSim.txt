1. This simulator was coded to simulate the recovery of CH4 from natural gas hydrate by injecting CO2 into the hydrate-bearing reservoirs.
2. The Chen-Guo thermodynamic model was coupled into this updated simulator.
3. Five pure gas (CH4, CO2, N2, C2H6, C3H8) and their mixtures can be simulated to form hydrates.
4. This simulator can be used in CO2 geoligical sequestration, CO2 enhanced natural gas hydrate recovery, 
5. The code name is CO2-EGHRSim V1.0 written in FORTRAN 90 and maintained by Dr. Hailong Tian. 
6. This code can be run on a PC with 3.4 GHz processor and 16 GB Ram. 
7. The code developed in this study is available from the corresponding author Hailong Tian (thl@jlu.edu.cn) upon reasonable request.
